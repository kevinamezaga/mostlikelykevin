### A Portfolio for People Who Care About Open Source

I designed [my portfolio](https://mostlikelykevin.com) for myself, obviously, but I deciced: hey, why don't I give this to people who don't have enough time to code their portfolio but really want something that stands out?

So I made this repo so you can literally clone it, pop it on a server (CloudWays is really great and cheap) and have your personal website up and running.

it's great for everyone from designers (like me) to web developers (like me) to artists, writers, and a lot of peopel in-between (like me).

### What it runs on

This web app is based on [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/) so you can check out their docs for how to get started [right here](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/installation.html).

Really, it's just `composer install` command in the "craft" directory to install dependencies and then a `php craft setup` and following instructions to configure your project. Pretty easy to be honest.

### How You Can Support

I'm a designer/web developer based in Miami. Short a job offer, you can support [my nonprofit, the Miami Riders Alliance](https://riders.miami) which advocates for safer streets and better transit in Miami-Dade County, Florida. We rely on community donations from people just like you to keep our work going, and I'd appreciate anything you can give.
